USAGE                                                               *www-usage*

|www.vim| just opens urls in your web browser. But |www.vim| understands
three types of url references:

* A typical URI, e.g. http://vim.org .
* A defined plain tag. E.g., tag {vimcom} can be configured to
 reference http://www.vim.org/community.php .
* A defined search engine tag. E.g., tag {g?} can be configured to
 search in google a query that can be provided.

Tags can be configured creating the dictionary |g:www_urls| in your .vimrc.
E.g.: >

    let g:www_urls = {
             \ 'vimcom' : 'http://www.vim.org/community.php',
             \ 'g?' : 'https://www.google.com/search?q=',
             \
             \ }
<
Notice that search engine tags end with a "?" character and that the search
query will be appended to the defined url (look at |g:www_urls| for more
details).

To open those urls you use the command |:Wopen|, which accepts multiple
arguments in order to open multiple urls. E.g.: >
    
    :Wopen http://vim.org vim g?vim\ scripts
<
Above command will open http://vim.org, http://www.vim.org/community.php urls
and the resulting url of searching the string "vim scripts" in google.

Notice that as it is a multiple arguments command you must scape blankspaces
in the string you provide to google search engine. Just for a matter of
convenience there is also the |:Wopen1| command which only accepts one
argument: >

    :Wopen1 g?vim scripts
<
You can also configure google or any other as your default search engine,
through: >

    let g:www_default_search_engine = 'g?
>
and then you can just do: >

    :Wsearch vim scripts

Urls can also be grouped in sessions in the following way: >

    let g:www_sessions = {
             \ 'vim' : ['http://vim.org', 'vimcom', 'g?vim scripts'],
             \
             \ }

Then you can open in one step all referenced urls with: >

    :Wsession vim
>
There are also some convenient mappings:

* |<leader>wo| . In normal mode it will open the browser using the |WORD|
 under the cursor as url reference. In visual mode it will do the same with
your text selection.

* |<leader>ws| . In normal mode it will search the |WORD| under the cursor in
 your default search engine. In visual mode it will do the same with your
text selection.

COMMANDS                                                         *www-commands*

                                                                      *:Wopen1*

:Wopen1 {urlreference} Opens {urlreference} in your browser. Url reference can
be a common URI, like "http://google.es", a plain tag, like "vim", or a search
engine tag, like "g?" followed by a search query (like "g?vim scripts"). Look
 at |g:www_urls| for information about how and where define tags.

                                                                       *:Wopen*

:Wopen {urlreference} [{urlreference}...] Opens url references in your
browser. Look at |:Wopen1| for information about {urlreference} values.

                                                                     :Wsession

:Wsession {sessionname} [{sessionname}...] Open one or more url sessions.
Look at |g:www_sessions| for information about how and where define session
names.

                                                                     *:Wsearch*

:Wsearch {query} Opens in your browser the page with the results of serching
{query} in your default search engine. Look at |g:www_default_search_engine|
for information about configuring your default search engine.

MAPPINGS                                                         *www-mappings*

<leader>wo In normal mode opens the |WORD| under the cursor as a url
reference. In visual mode, does the same with the text selection. Look at
 |:Wopen1| for information about what a url reference can be.


                                                                  *<leader>ws*

<leader>ws In normal mode opens your browser with the page with the results
of searching the |WORD| under the cursor in your default search engine. In
visual mode, does the same with the text selection. Look at
|g:www_default_search_engine| for information about how to configure your
default search engine.
==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                               *www-configuration*

                                                                  *g:www_urls*

A dictionary that contains your favourite tags. Keys are plain tags or search
engine tags.

Keys that are plain tags are words without spaces nor '?' symbols.  Their values
are the actual url they reference. E.g.: >

    let g:www_urls = {
         \ 'vim': 'http://vim.org',
    \ }

Keys that are search engine tags are words without spaces that end with '?'.
Their values are urls that will be appended with provided search query. If
the search query should be somewhere else (not at the end) use "{{QUERY}}" as
placeholder. E.g.: >

    let g:www_urls = {
         \ 'g?': 'https://www.google.com/search?q='
         \ 'gh?': 'https://github.com/search?q={{QUERY}}&ref=simplesearch'
    \ }
<
                                                                  *g:sessions*

A dictionary that contains your sessions. Keys are words without spaces and
values are lists of plain tags or search engine tags with their search query.
Tags have to be defined in |g:www_urls| or in www.vim defaults. E.g.: >

    let g:www_sessions = {
        \ 'vim': ['vim', 'g?vim scriping']
    \ }
<
                                                 *g:www_default_search_engine*

Default search engine to use. The value is a search engine tag, like "g?" or
"y?" present in |g:www_urls| or in www.vim defaults.

                                                *g:www_launch_browser_command*

The command that will be used to launch your browser. If it is not set
(default), www.vim will try to make the best guess. Use "{{URL}}" placeholder
to tell where the actual url should be. E.g.: >

    let g:www_launch_browser_command = "icewasel {{URL}} &"
<
                                                              *g:www_map_keys*

Set this variable to 0 if you don't want |www-mappings| to be used.
